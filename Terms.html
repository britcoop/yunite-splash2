<p>5.  Grids that are 'Public' shared may be promoted and linked by Yunite as example uses of the Service. These grids may also be indexed by search engines.</p>
<p>6.  Yunite has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Yunite's sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Yunite's reasonable opinion, violates any Yunite policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in Yunite's sole discretion. Yunite will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</p>
<p>7.  Yunite reserves the right to modify or terminate the Service for any reason, without notice at any time.</p>
<p>8.  You must not modify, adapt or hack the Service or modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service.</p>

<p>10. An upgrade from a free plan to a paid plan will charge you for your first month immediately upon upgrading.</p>
<p>11. The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.</p>
<p>12. Yunite shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</p>
<p>13. Customers may access Yunite data via an API (Application Program Interface).

<p>o You understand and agree that Yunite shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Yunite has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from the use of the API.</p>
<p>o Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Yunite via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your access to the API.

            <div class="panel">

                <p>By using the yunite.co web site ('Service') a service of Yunite ('Yunite'), you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms and conditions.</p>
                
                <p>1.  You must be a human at least 13 years of age. Accounts registered by 'bots' or other automated methods are not permitted.</p>
                <p>2.  You must provide a valid email address to use the Service.</p>
                <p>3.  You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password, and you are fully responsible for all content posted and all activities that occur under your account and any other actions taken in connection with your account. You must not abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate other users of the Service, and you must not create or submit unwanted email to any users of the Service or any other entity.</p>
                <p>4.  You may not use the Service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).</p>
                <p>5.  Grids that are 'Public' shared may be promoted and linked by Yunite as example uses of the Service. These grids may also be indexed by search engines.</p>
                <p>6.  Yunite has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Yunite's sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Yunite's reasonable opinion, violates any Yunite policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in Yunite's sole discretion. Yunite will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.</p>
                <p>7.  Yunite reserves the right to modify or terminate the Service for any reason, without notice at any time.</p>
                <p>8.  You must not modify, adapt or hack the Service or modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service.</p>
                <p>9.  You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. All of your Content will be immediately deleted from the Service upon cancellation. This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.</p>
                <p>10. An upgrade from a free plan to a paid plan will charge you for your first month immediately upon upgrading.</p>
                <p>11. The Service is billed in advance on a monthly basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.</p>
                <p>12. Yunite shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.</p>
                <p>13. Customers may access Yunite data via an API (Application Program Interface). By using the Yunite API (whether directly or programmatically or through a third-party product, or to create a product/website/application, or in any other way), you are bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following terms:</p>
                <p>o You understand and agree that Yunite shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Yunite has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from the use of the API.</p>
                <p>o Abuse or excessively frequent requests to Yunite via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your access to the API. Yunite, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. Yunite will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn the account owner prior to suspension.</p>
                <p>(i) Yunite reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p>
                <p>(ii) To ensure that you are able to promote your integration without creating confusion about the creator of the offering, you must adhere to the following branding guidelines:</p>
                <p>You may not use the text 'Yunite' in the name of your product, website or application (e.g. 'Yunite for Desktop' is unacceptable). If your creation is compatible with Yunite, you can make a reference to Yunite by using the text 'for', 'for use with', or 'compatible with', and be sure to include the trademark symbol with it (e.g. 'XYZ Software for Yunite trademark').</p>
                <p>You may not use the Yunite logo or Yunite icon or a modified version of either as a logo or icon to your product, website or application.</p>
                <p>14. Yunite reserves the right to change this Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service. Continued use of the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.</p>
                <p>Violation of any of these agreements will result in the termination of your Account. While Yunite prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that Yunite cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.</p>
